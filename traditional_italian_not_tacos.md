This is not a taco, neither tacos.


# Ingredients

- 100% flour
- 66% water
- 2% salt
- less than 1% yeast
- 1 tbsp olive oil

We are using grams! So, if we use 300gr of flour, we will have 200gr of water, 6 grams of salt etc..


Incorporate flour, water, salt and yeast. 
Mix it until smooth; if tired, let the dough rest for 10 mins and go back neading. Almost at the end add the olive oil, and finish kneading.

Let it proof in a warm place until it double in volume (it depends on the amount of yeast and the room temperature).


Flatten the dough in a oven pan (usually the rectangle black pan with parchment paper).
Add tomato sauce on top and bake it for almost 15 mins in the lower position of the oven. 

After the bottom is cooked, take it out, put mozzarella or other toppings and bake it again for 5 to 10 mins, until the mozzarella is melted but not burned.
